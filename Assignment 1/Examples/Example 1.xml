			<abstract>
				Are academic branch libraries going to be extinct in the near future? In
				these difficult economic times, when collections are digitized rapidly,
				is there still a need for a separate unit within proximity to the
				department, school, or college with a subject-based or subject-specific
				collection? Academic Branch Libraries in Changing Times gives a brief
				historical overview of the role of a branch academic library. It reviews
				the current situation from a practitioner’s point of view and suggests
				solutions for the future.

			<abstract>
				Understanding acoustics – the science of sound -- is essential for audio
				and communications engineers working in media technology. It is also
				extremely important for engineers to understand what allows a sound to
				be heard in the way it is, what makes speech intelligible, and how a
				particular sound is recognized within a multitude of sounds. Acoustic
				Signals and Hearing: A Time-Envelope and Phase Spectral Approach is
				unique in presenting the principles of sound and sound fields from
				the perspective of hearing, particularly through the use of speech and
				musical sounds.

				Acoustic Signals and Hearing: A Time-Envelope and Phase Spectral
				Approach is an ideal resource for researchers and acoustic engineers
				working in today’s environment of media technology, and graduate
				students studying acoustics, audio engineering, and signal processing.
